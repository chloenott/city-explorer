## Overview

This is a class assignment for Code Fellows 301. This is a city guide app that enables a user to search for a city to map its location, to list what movies are related to that city, and to show the weather forecast.

## Getting Started

The client side of this app runs in most modern browsers, and an internet connection will be needed for the API calls. The server side of this app needs to be installed onto server capable of running nodejs. Relevant API keys will need to be supplied to the server and client side hosts.

## Architecture

Written in JavaScript using the React (for UI) and Axios (for API calls) libraries. LocationIQ is the API used for getting location data. Additional API calls are made to a custom nodejs/express server, which in turn makes API calls to get movie and weather data.

## Change Log

1/1/21: First release that implements the location functionality.
1/2/21: Added placeholder weather data.
1/3/21: Added live weather and movie data.

## Credit and Collaborations

Code Fellows 301 course material for user stories and requirements for the app.
