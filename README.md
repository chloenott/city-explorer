## Overview

This is a class assignment for Code Fellows 301. This is a city guide app that enables a user to search for a city to map its location, to find out what movies are showing and to find out what the weather will be like.

## Getting Started

The client side of this app runs in most modern browsers, and an internet connection will be needed for the API calls. The host for the website will need to be provided API keys. TODO: Server side to come later.

## Architecture

Written in JavaScript using the React (for UI) and Axios (for API calls) libraries. LocationIQ is the API used for getting location data.

## Change Log

1/1/21: First release that implements the location functionality.

## Credit and Collaborations

Code Fellows 301 course material for user stories and requirements for the app.
